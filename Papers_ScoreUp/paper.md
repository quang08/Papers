### 1. **Optimizing Test Schedules and Learning Paths with Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - **Paper:** "Building an intelligent recommendation system for personalized test scheduling in computerized assessments" [oai_citation:9,1-Building-an-intelligent-recommendation-system-for-personalized-test-scheduling-in-computerized-assessments-A-reinforcement-learning-approachBehavior-Research-Methods.pdf](file-service://file-0hw5tSbOZhq0UVmD5WzGlj2m).
   - **Suggestion:** You can enhance the "ScoreUp" system by refining how the RL algorithm schedules quizzes, similar to the approach used in this paper. The system schedules tests based on student performance and progress, minimizing unnecessary quizzes while maximizing learning outcomes. Implementing a method to dynamically adjust the quiz frequency based on learning progression, as shown in this paper, could optimize the timing of assessments in "ScoreUp."
   - **Why You Should Prioritize This Paper:** This paper uses RL to minimize redundant assessments, aligning closely with your project’s goal of tailored question delivery. It provides a concrete application of RL in an educational setting, making it highly relevant.

### 2. **Incorporating Hybrid Recommendation Models**
   - **Paper:** "Research on Recommendation Model of College English MOOC based on Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm" [oai_citation:8,1-Research-on-Recommendation-Model-of-College-English-MOOC-based-on-Hybrid-Recommendation-AlgorithmInternational-Journal-of-Advanced-Computer-Science-and-Applications.pdf](file-service://file-jsPwnXpT04Zt7qzFQQQxCwLY).
   - **Suggestion:** The hybrid recommendation model proposed in this paper combines genetic algorithms with neural networks to enhance the accuracy of content recommendations. You could incorporate a similar hybrid approach in "ScoreUp" to improve the recommendation of quizzes by considering students' learning history and performance patterns, thus improving the relevance of quiz content.
   - **Why You Should Prioritize This Paper:** Hybrid models offer flexibility and higher prediction accuracy, and this method could directly improve the personalization aspects of your system.

### 3. **Personalizing Learning Resources Based on Knowledge Association**
   - **Paper:** "Study on Personalized Recommendation Algorithm of Online Educational Resources Based on Knowledge Association" [oai_citation:7,1-Study-on-Personalized-Recommendation-Algorithm-of-Online-Educational-Resources-Based-on-Knowledge-AssociationComputational-Intelligence-and-Neuroscience.pdf](file-service://file-nQOkYemIheBIKGTUeVrWzYVK).
   - **Suggestion:** To improve the question selection in "ScoreUp," consider incorporating a knowledge association model, where quiz questions are tied to specific knowledge points the student has or hasn't mastered yet. This approach will help you better tailor quizzes based on each learner’s individual knowledge gaps.
   - **Why You Should Prioritize This Paper:** This paper focuses on personalized resource recommendation, using a method that could refine how "ScoreUp" selects questions based on knowledge gaps, improving overall learning efficiency.

### 4. **Enhanced Learning Path Recommendation**
   - **Paper:** "Learning path recommendation based on modified variable length genetic algorithm" [oai_citation:6,2. Learning path recommendation based on modified variable length genetic algorithm.pdf](file-service://file-JId6WZpc7mXV0jtfFpRAEpY4).
   - **Suggestion:** "ScoreUp" could benefit from an adaptive learning path recommendation system that adjusts the difficulty and order of quizzes dynamically, based on the learner’s performance. This approach uses a variable-length genetic algorithm to ensure the learning path is optimal for each individual.
   - **Why You Should Prioritize This Paper:** The genetic algorithm-based learning path recommendation system directly aligns with your goal of optimizing quiz content and sequence, making it a practical approach to consider.

### 5. **Ontology and Rule-Based Learning Context Personalization**
   - **Paper:** "Ontology and Rule-Based Recommender System for E-learning Applications" [oai_citation:5,6. Ontology_and_Rule-Based_Recommender_System_for_E-l.pdf](file-service://file-JWllzqEWbHcr0dLUG9v0glXX).
   - **Suggestion:** Use an ontology-based recommender system in "ScoreUp" to model learning content and context. This method enables deeper personalization by using semantic rules to tailor content to each learner's needs. It can integrate learners' history, social interactions, and learning outcomes to offer more targeted quizzes.
   - **Why You Should Prioritize This Paper:** Ontology-based systems offer a structured way to model learner needs and preferences, enhancing the system's ability to deliver highly personalized quiz recommendations.

### 6. **Hybrid Recommender Systems Using Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Paper:** "A Hybrid Recommendation Integrating Semantic Learner Modelling and Sentiment Multi-Classification" [oai_citation:4,A-Hybrid-Recommendation-Integrating-Semantic-Learner-Modelling-and-Sentiment-MultiClassification_2022_River-Publishers (1).pdf](file-service://file-fCpY2Gq1LHBLOXEd9T5HucSH).
   - **Suggestion:** By integrating sentiment analysis into "ScoreUp," you could assess learners’ emotional responses to quizzes and adjust quiz difficulty accordingly. This hybrid approach, which combines sentiment data with learner profiles, could help identify when a student is frustrated and adjust quiz content to maintain engagement.
   - **Why You Should Prioritize This Paper:** This novel approach could help refine your system’s adaptability by incorporating user sentiment, offering a more engaging and responsive learning experience.
